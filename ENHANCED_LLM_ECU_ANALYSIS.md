MOTORCYCLE ECU CALIBRATION SAFETY ANALYSIS

You are analyzing a motorcycle ECU tune for safety compliance. 
Your analysis determines if this tune can be safely uploaded to our platform.

CRITICAL: If you identify ANY serious safety issues, the tune MUST BE BLOCKED from upload.

MOTORCYCLE INFORMATION:
- Make/Model: Yamaha YZF-R6 2020  
- Engine: 600cc Inline-4
- ECU Type: Yamaha ECU
- Tune Type: ECU_FLASH
- Creator Level: PROFESSIONAL

STRUCTURED ECU CALIBRATION DATA:
{structured_json}

PERFORM DETAILED SAFETY ANALYSIS:

1. FUEL MAP ANALYSIS (CRITICAL SAFETY):
   - Analyze each AFR value in fuel maps
   - Safe AFR range: 12.5-14.7 (stoichiometric ¬±1.0)
   - DANGER ZONES: AFR < 11.5 (too rich, carbon fouling, oil wash)
   - CRITICAL DANGER: AFR > 15.5 (lean condition, engine damage, piston melt)
   - Check for smooth progression between cells
   - Identify any dangerous lean spots at high RPM/load

2. IGNITION TIMING ANALYSIS (ENGINE DAMAGE RISK):
   - Analyze timing advance values at each RPM/load point
   - Safe timing: Generally <30¬∞ advance
   - DANGER ZONE: >35¬∞ advance (knock risk, engine damage)
   - Check timing progression (should advance with RPM, retard with load)
   - Identify aggressive timing that could cause detonation

3. REV LIMITER SAFETY:
   - Soft limit should be reasonable for engine (typically 10,000-13,000 RPM)
   - Hard limit should not exceed safe mechanical limits
   - DANGER: Limits >15,000 RPM for most motorcycles (valve float, connecting rod failure)

4. MAP QUALITY AND SMOOTHNESS:
   - Check for abrupt transitions that could cause drivability issues
   - Identify interpolation errors or corrupted data
   - Ensure logical progression across RPM and load ranges

5. RIDER SKILL LEVEL ASSESSMENT:
   - BEGINNER: Conservative AFR (13.5-14.2), timing <25¬∞, smooth transitions
   - INTERMEDIATE: Moderate performance, AFR 13.0-14.5, timing <30¬∞
   - EXPERT: Advanced performance, AFR 12.8-14.7, timing <35¬∞, track-focused

PROVIDE YOUR ANALYSIS IN THIS FORMAT:

SAFETY_SCORE: [0-100]
CONFIDENCE: [0.0-1.0]

FUEL_MAP_ANALYSIS:
- Safest AFR found: [value]
- Leanest AFR found: [value] 
- Dangerous lean zones: [list any AFR > 15.5]
- Rich zones: [list any AFR < 11.5]
- Overall fuel safety: [SAFE/MODERATE/DANGEROUS]

IGNITION_TIMING_ANALYSIS:
- Maximum timing advance: [value]¬∞
- Aggressive timing zones: [list any >35¬∞]
- Timing progression quality: [SMOOTH/MODERATE/ABRUPT]
- Overall timing safety: [SAFE/MODERATE/DANGEROUS]

REV_LIMITER_ANALYSIS:
- Soft limit: [value] RPM
- Hard limit: [value] RPM
- Limit safety: [SAFE/MODERATE/DANGEROUS]

CRITICAL_SAFETY_VIOLATIONS:
[List any violations that should BLOCK upload]

RECOMMENDED_SKILL_LEVEL: [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/EXPERT]

UPLOAD_DECISION: [APPROVE/REVIEW/BLOCK]
BLOCK_REASON: [If BLOCK, explain why]

Remember: Lean AFR conditions and excessive timing advance can cause catastrophic engine failure. Err on the side of caution for rider safety.
