## 🏍️ **REAL USE CASE FOR YOUR MOTORCYCLE SYSTEM - WORKING EXAMPLE**

### **Scenario: User uploads dangerous .bin file → parsed → safety issue detected at 9,000 RPM**

**HybridRAG Enhancement Pipeline:**

```python
# 1. VECTOR SEARCH TRIGGERS
🔍 Semantic Query: "AFR 16.2 at 9000 RPM Yamaha R6 lean condition safety"
📊 Results: 3 similar tunes with AFR warnings
💯 Similarity Score: 0.89 (high confidence)

# 2. GRAPH TRAVERSAL TRIGGERS  
🕸️ Graph Query: Tune → yamaha_r6 → dangerous_afr → safety_patterns
📈 Results: 5 previous tunes flagged for lean conditions
🚨 Pattern: "dangerous_afr_pattern" (7 instances found)

# 3. MANUFACTURER WARNINGS
🏭 Yamaha Specific: "R6 engines sensitive to lean conditions above 10,000 RPM"
📋 Safety Threshold: AFR 12.8-14.5 safe for R6, >15.5 dangerous

# 4. ENHANCED LLM CONTEXT
🧠 LLM receives: Structured data + similar tune history + graph relationships + manufacturer warnings
```

**HybridRAG Enhanced LLM Response:**
```
🚨 UPLOAD_DECISION: BLOCK
📝 BLOCK_REASON: "Dangerous lean AFR 16.2 detected with historical pattern validation"

CRITICAL_SAFETY_VIOLATIONS:
- AFR 16.2 exceeds safe limit 14.5 for Yamaha R6 (engine damage risk)
- Historical analysis: 7 similar tunes flagged for lean AFR conditions  
- Manufacturer warning: R6 engines sensitive to lean conditions above 10,000 RPM
- Pattern match: dangerous_afr_pattern with multiple reported incidents

HISTORICAL_SAFETY_VALIDATION:
- Similar tune safety record: CONCERNING
- Pattern match concerns: 7 previous R6 tunes blocked for similar AFR issues
- Manufacturer-specific risks: High-revving R6 engine prone to piston damage
```

dangerous_timing → MATCH (42° > 35° threshold) 

# Safety Pattern Analysis
dangerous_afr_pattern: 4 ZX-10R tunes blocked for lean AFR
dangerous_timing_pattern: 3 ZX-10R tunes blocked for timing >40°

# HybridRAG Decision  
🔍 Vector Confidence: 0.95 (high similarity to dangerous tunes)
🕸️ Graph Confidence: 0.92 (clear pattern match)
🧠 Combined Confidence: 0.94
❌ DECISION: BLOCKED - "Multiple safety violations with historical pattern validation"

```

### **⏳ Example 3: Marginal Honda CBR Tune - MANUAL REVIEW**

**HybridRAG Analysis:**
```python
# Input Tune
File: honda_cbr600rr_track.bin

safe_tune → Borderline classification

# Low Confidence Analysis
🔍 Vector Confidence: 0.67 (limited similar data)
🕸️ Graph Confidence: 0.54 (sparse graph connections)
🧠 Combined Confidence: 0.61

# Conservative Decision Logic  
HybridRAG Insight: "Limited historical validation data - exercising extra caution"
